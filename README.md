Great, based on your folder structure and the fact that you're using the Wine Quality dataset in an end-to-end ML pipeline (with stages like data ingestion, validation, transformation, training, and evaluation using MLflow), here is a professional and detailed `README.md` you can use:

# 🍷 Wine Quality Prediction - End-to-End ML Project with MLOps

This project is an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for predicting wine quality using the [Wine Quality Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality). It follows MLOps best practices including modular coding, logging, configuration management, experiment tracking with MLflow, and version control with Git.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Predict the quality of wine based on its physicochemical properties like acidity, sugar, pH, etc.

---

## ⚙️ Pipeline Stages

1. **Data Ingestion**
   - Downloads and stores the dataset locally.

2. **Data Validation**
   - Verifies schema consistency and data integrity.

3. **Data Transformation**
   - Feature engineering, scaling, train-test split.

4. **Model Training**
   - Trains a regression model (e.g., Random Forest, Linear Regression) using parameters defined in `params.yaml`.

5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Calculates RMSE, MAE, R² score.
   - Logs results and model artifacts to **MLflow**.

---

## 📊 MLflow Integration

- The project uses **MLflow** integrated with **DagsHub** to:
  - Track experiments
  - Log model performance
  - Register models

---
